<p>
  Gosu is a <strong>2D game development library</strong> for Ruby and C++.
</p>

<p>
  It’s available for <strong>macOS, Windows, Linux (including Raspbian),</strong> and <a href="cpp.html">iOS</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Gosu is focused, lightweight and has few dependencies (mostly <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL 2</a>). It provides:
  <ul>
    <li> a window and a main loop
    <li> 2D graphics and text, powered by OpenGL or OpenGL&nbsp;ES
    <li> sounds and music
    <li> keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Gosu is mostly used to teach or learn Ruby or in <a href="https://ldjam.com">short game development competitions</a>.
  It’s also a great prototyping tool and should work for indie game development, though nobody has really tried that.

  In addition to the documentation linked from the sidebar, there is a <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/msgpkids/learn-game-programming-with-ruby">book by Mark Sobkowicz</a> that will guide you through the creation of four different games:

  Both Gosu’s documentation and the book assume that you used Ruby before.
